<h2>seriously, what the fuck else do you want ?</h2>
<p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going <a href =#>to</a> get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>

<h2>seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
	<li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
	<li>Looks at the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
	<li>the mother fucker's accessible to every asshole that visite your site</li>
	<li>Shit's legible and gets yours fucking point across (if you had one insteadofjust 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
</ul>
<h3>well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>you. Are. Over-designing. look at this shit.It's q mother fucker............................ over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on .......................................... sausage fingers will never see that shit. <a href= #>Not </a>to mention</p>
<p>You never knew it' but this is your perfect website.</p>
